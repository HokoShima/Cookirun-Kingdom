        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p class="Game">Cookie Run: Kingdom is an RPG & city-building battle simulator. The game is mainly played by building the player's Cookie Kingdom and collecting Cookies using the game's gacha to fight in various game modes.<br>
            At the beginning of the game, players receive a piece of land to build structures and amenities and aid the player in collecting resources. To unlock more items/resources, the player must level up the Cookie Castle, production buildings, and the Fountain of Abundance. Furthermore, players will have to build additional structures to use for either trading or upgrading. Players can produce resources for their Kingdom with various production buildings. The Cookie Castle can be upgraded when given enough items or cleared certain tasks, and this allows the player to expand the space available, and level up buildings and place more of them. The same applies to the offline reward-giving Fountain of Abundance. The player can also expand their land by using materials or fighting enemies in certain areas with their team.<br><br>       
            There are 74 playable Cookies in the game, used as the main fighting units for the game's various game modes. These Cookies, can be obtained from the game's gacha, which can be activated by spending Crystals, or specific event tokens for a specific Cookie. Crystals are earned through various methods in the game or can be purchased with real-life money. Cookies are placed in teams of up to five by the player. There are 7 rarities of cookie, ranging from Common to Legendary, and 8 classes of cookie that serve different functions in battle. For example, Support cookies provide a mix of healing, damage and temporary buffs for allies, and Magic cookies can debuff enemies. All cookies have a skill that can be activated, which causes damage, healing, or other effects. These skills have a short cooldown before being able to be used again.<br><br>    
            Cookies can be powered up by various means. General stats, which are HP, Attack, and Defense, are upgraded by leveling up the characters, primarily done through EXP Candies. EXP Candies are obtained from playing through the game's multiple modes, or through Cookie Houses that give EXP Candies over time. The power of a skill can be increased with Skill Powders, which are obtained through daily bounties that give a specific type of Skill Powder. Toppings can be put on a cookie to improve other stats, such as how long it takes for a skill to cool down, or how much a cookie will be affected by a debuff. Up to 5 can be equipped, and have to be upgraded using coins and topping pieces. 3 cookies can be given items called Magic Candies that power up and give new effects to their skill. Magic Candies require a specific type of Crystal and Resonant Ingredient to upgrade. Cookies are obtained through soulstones, and obtaining a certain amount of soulstones for a cookie if you already have it will give you a chance to promote it up to 5 stars, which greatly increase HP, Attack, and Defense. After a cookie has reached 5 stars they can be upgraded further through Ascension, which requires Soulcores (a version of Soulstones that is unlocked after promoting a cookie to 5 stars) and Soul Essences.<br><br>
            The main story mode, known as World Exploration, contains multiple levels that are played in order. Each level is played by using a team of Cookies to attack multiple enemies, and on some levels, making their cookies jump to collect coins, similar to previous Cookie Run games. Over time, other modes are added that function in a similar way but with different approaches (see Features section)<br><br></p>

        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p class="Story">In the past, three witches tried to come up with a great recipe for making magic cookies with ingredients such as Colorful sugar, butter, moonlight, Whisper's powder, and Life's powder. This gave birth to living cookies. They at first are delighted with the new world, but when they realized they're going to be eaten, they fled, leaving the witches with unbaked magical flour. But then, the batter gets exposed to sunlight over time, building more cookies. As generations passed, the 5 special cookies, Pure Vanilla, Hollyberry, Golden Cheese, Dark Cacao, & White Lily built their own civilizations. They are complemented with Soul Jams, which grant them eternal youth for them to rule in harmony.<br><br>
            The witches, however, still have some Life powder, creating what is known as Cake Monsters. One day, a cookie seeks to know why they're made, & after seeing the horrible truth, gets plunged into the batter. That cookie came to be known as Dark Enchantress Cookie. She then leads the monsters to attack all of Earthbread. The Ancient Cookies join forces to fight her, only to get bested by the last minute & got their Soul Jam's taken. At that moment, Pure Vanilla Cookie uses his last remaining power to attack her, causing an explosion that leaves their fate unresolved. After that, their kingdoms had fallen with no realization of what happened. Centuries later, a new light had come by the name of Gingerbrave, as he left the oven & into a new era.<br><br></p>
